<p>The PED (Phase Equilibria Diagrams) Editor was created by Eric
Boesch for use by the PED Data Center (<a href="https://www.nist.gov/srd/nist-standard-reference-database-31v40">NIST Standard Reference
Database 31</a>) to digitize various types of phase equilibria diagrams
for addition to this series as graphics files. Binary, ternary, and
schematic diagrams can be digitized, and data can be extracted. The
PED Editor can also be used for general graph digitization and
two-dimensional scientific drawing.

<p>A Getting Started User Manual can be downloaded <a href="PED%20Editor%20User%20Guide.pdf">here</a>.
  
<p>For technical support: send email to <a href="mailto:phase2@nist.gov">phase2@nist.gov</a> with "PED Editor" in the subject line.

<h2>System requirements</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.java.com/">Java</a>™ programming language, Java 8 or better (<a href="http://www.java.com/">free download</a> from java.com).

  <li>2- or 3-button mouse (systems with no second button, or no mouse at all, are not supported)

  <li>Screen resolution 1024x768 or better (dual monitors may be useful)

  <li>Any operating system for which Java is available may work. Platforms that have been tested with the PED Editor include Windows™ 7, 8, and 10, and Mac OS X 10.11 and 10.12.
    
  <li>At least 512MB of memory and at least 1 GHz processor speed</li>
</ul>

<p>Java must be installed in order to run this program.

<p> The Java Web Start version includes automatic updates when new
  versions are available. On Windows, the Java Web Start version also
  supports opening the program automatically when you click on PED
  Editor diagram files in the Windows Explorer. The Java Web Start
  version of the PED Editor does not run directly out of the browser,
  and your browser does not need to support the Java plugin.</p>
  
<p>If you do not wish to enable Java Web Start, you can still download
  the JAR file, locate it using the file explorer program for your
  operating system, and double-click to open the file.

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Diagrams can be saved as high-quality scalable <code>PDF</code>
  or in <code>GIF</code>, <code>PNG</code>, or <code>JPG</code>
  format.

  <li>Diagrams use logical coordinates which can be translated by
  constant or linear factors, such as between Celsuis, Fahrenheit, and
  Kelvin. Stretching the diagram does not affect logical coordinate
  values. Store coordinates with up to 15 digit precision.

  <li>General scientific diagram support includes many axis labelling
  options, isotherms (labels superimposed on and tangent to a curve),
  a variety of line and fill styles, and color. The Unicode fonts
  include a variety of math and scientific symbols and data markers,
  and labels can be marked up with basic HTML.
    
  <li>Chemical phase diagram support includes tie lines, ternary
  diagrams, conversion between chemical formulas and diagram
  locations, conversion between weight and mole fraction, and
  automatic subscripting of chemical formulas.

  <li>Math support includes locating curve intersections and nearest
  curves. Display curve slope, arc length, area enclosed by a
  curve, and integral under a curve.

  <li>Digitization and diagram cleanup support includes automatic
  correction of distorted or misaligned scanned diagrams and a second
  window to show the corresponding position in the original image.
  Identify the boundaries and logical coordinates of a graph, then
  trace data points and curves.

    <p>Currently only manual digitization is supported, without
      automatic edge and vertex detection. However, most widely
      available automatic digitization programs are not as precise as
      manual visual digitization.

</ul>

<h2>Licensing</h2>

<p>The PED Editor is free. If you just want to run the program, either
  to digitize existing diagrams or create new ones in any format, you
  may do so without restriction.
  
<p>If you wish to sell, redistribute, or modifying the PED Editor, or
  to embed it in a larger work, you must consult the "About" section
  of the program's Help menu for license restrictions. NIST does not
  impose any restrictions on the use of the PED Editor or its source
  code beyond those that are necessary to comply with the terms of the
  included third-party libraries.
